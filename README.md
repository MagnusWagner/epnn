Partner code to "Electron-Passing Neural Networks for Atomic Charge Prediction in Systems with Arbitrary Molecular Charge"

EPNNs are an extensible framework to encode graph-level conservation properties (such as conservation of charge in molecular systems) while operating only locally on portions of the graph. Use EPNNs for cheminformatics, force field charges, or as input to neural network potentials. Train and test your own EPNNs on your systems. Requires TensorFlow 2.x, numpy, scipy, and sklearn.
