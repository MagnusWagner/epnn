# Electron-Passing Neural Networks with jraph


### Current Status:
- runs the EPNN Algorithm with jraph, haiku (instead of flax) and jax functionalities.
- efficiency improvements in the batch function (2.2s for all 500 samples).
- comparison of model performance during training for training and val set.
- End-to-End Pipeline built with batch-loading to use whole training-set efficiently
- Different activation functions built
- other possibilities for edge features enabled
- Simple visualization (pred vs. ground truth in Notebook)
- Hyperparameter optimization pipeline built


### ToDo
- Write user guide
- Write report
